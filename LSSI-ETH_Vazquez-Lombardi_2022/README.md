Custom code for data analysis from "TCR-Engine: A high-throughput method for T cell receptor engineering and functional screening for the identification of therapeutic candidates". It also contains visualization code and example datasets in .fastq or .csv file format.

We show the NGS DMS analysis in the ngs_dms_processing_enrichment_A3 folder structure as well as our peptide scanning process in peptidescanning_scanprosite_processing_A305.
